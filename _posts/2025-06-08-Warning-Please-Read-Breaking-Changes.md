This site is set to go through a massive overhaul. Console Service Tool is getting a complete rebuild. The current tool is a desktop tool for windows. The latest will be able to run directly from a chrome or edge browser on pc/mac/linux. The old desktop version will continue to run however the TSB and guides will no longer work as they are linked to my server.

I have big plans for Console Service Tool, if this is a project that might interest you please reach out to support@fixmy.repair. 

The new Console Service Tool will support XBox Post code reading as well. Stay Tuned!
